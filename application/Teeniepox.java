	 * the rolled amount of counters from the hex they are on.
	 *
	 * When determining the largest stack, count each village, city, and fort by its combat value.
	 * Creatures and special characters count as one.

	 * If a tie occurs, the player being affected chooses which one s/he loses.

	 * If not enough creatures exist on the hex being infected, the player must reduce
	 * forts, cities, and villages to meet the loss requirements.
